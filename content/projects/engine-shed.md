After some playing around with a pringles pipe as a shed i decided to upgrade to a 3d printed one.

## Research

Ok, calling it a research might be total overkill, but I googled for some pictures and found some nice modern sheds as a baseline.

## Design

1. Started with some flat walls that soon got upgraded `corrugated iron` look and some windows
1. adding a flat roof that got extended by some roof openings
1. printed the parts and noticed putting them together is hard if you don't have a base to put them on
1. created a base with some guidelines for the walls cared out of it
1. added some doors (with just some tape acting as a hinge and spring at the same time)
1. placed a locomotive on a track and drove in : party ;)

## Get some details


1. Added a walkway to place later on some figures inside
1. designed some window frames and glued some transparent plastic waste behind it.
1. oh - its dark inside ...
1. googled for some light ideas and came up with 3 LEDs from a LED Strip
1. created a cabelcanal and used it to hide the wire and upside down to have a enclosure for the LEDs

## Refactoring

1. as i used code to build all the stuff in openSCAD, it was time to clean up the code
1. added a small and ugly ps script to generate a website with preview images

## Last touch for now

1. used the refactored code to recreate the doors and designed them as 2 peaces to have color without painting it


## Conclusion

Was a lot of fun to create, learned a lot about openSCAD and i have a small engine shed now.
