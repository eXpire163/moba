## Why another page about model railroads?

When it comes to model railroads, you soon stumble over lots of new terms you have most likely never heard before. And when you start googeling for them you either get answers with more terms you don't understand or a product that is quite expense.


## What you find here (hopefully)

I was starting out with a starter kit from Märklin and soon noticed - i want to control stuff not only by hand or the `Mobile Station 2`. I would like to control stuff with my phone / pc / raspberry ... So i wanted to build a setup that fits my comfort zone.

**In the zone**
- Raspberry Pi
- Arduino
- Linux (a bit)
- Development / Setup of software

**Not in my zone**
- PCB development
- Soldering smd stuff
- low level chip programming
- spending lots of money

Thats where i started googeling and soon found my first approach to control a digital Märklin H0 scale train with my raspberry. Stage two is still in progress but goes in to directon of automating thinks. Could be a shuttle train or station with a "random" train picker - we will see. The tech needed is the same anyway. For stage three i think of adding more signals, automated switches and other funny stuff.
