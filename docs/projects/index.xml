      <description>Why another page about model railroads? When it comes to model railroads, you soon stumble over lots of new terms you have most likely never heard before. And when you start googeling for them you either get answers with more terms you don&amp;rsquo;t understand or a product that is quite expense.
What you find here (hopefully) I was starting out with a starter kit from MÃ¤rklin and soon noticed - i want to control stuff not only by hand or the Mobile Station 2.</description>

      <description>To know or not to know &amp;hellip; As i&amp;rsquo;m looking quite often in new (tech) topics, i would like to share some of my learnings with you and also persist the stuff i learned a little bit.
What to find here Most likely not too much - as documentation is not always the first thinks people like todo ;)</description>
