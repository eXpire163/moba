<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<ol>
<li>Started with some flat walls that soon got upgraded <code>corrugated iron</code> look and some windows</li>
<li>adding a flat roof that got extended by some roof openings</li>
<li>printed the parts and noticed putting them together is hard if you don&rsquo;t have a base to put them on</li>
<li>created a base with some guidelines for the walls cared out of it</li>
<li>added some doors (with just some tape acting as a hinge and spring at the same time)</li>
<li>placed a locomotive on a track and drove in : party ;)</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="./images/engine-shed/indoor.jpg" alt="indoor"></p>
<h2 id="get-some-details">Get some details</h2>
<ol>
<li>Added a walkway to place later on some figures inside</li>
<li>designed some window frames and glued some transparent plastic waste behind it.</li>
<li>oh - its dark inside &hellip;</li>
<li>googled for some light ideas and came up with 3 LEDs from a LED Strip</li>
<li>created a cabelcanal and used it to hide the wire and upside down to have a enclosure for the LEDs</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="./images/engine-shed/outdoor.jpg" alt="outdoor"></p>
<h2 id="refactoring">Refactoring</h2>
<ol>
<li>as i used code to build all the stuff in openSCAD, it was time to clean up the code</li>
<li>added a small and ugly ps script to generate a website with preview images</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="last-touch-for-now">Last touch for now</h2>
<ol>
<li>used the refactored code to recreate the doors and designed them as 2 peaces to have color without painting it</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Was a lot of fun to create, learned a lot about openSCAD and i have a small engine shed now.</p>
